/**
 * The two donation buttons every README needs beside the Buy Me a Coffee one.
 *
 * WHY THEY LIVE HERE: the row of three appears in the README of every
 * repository, and the images are the same three files each time. Kept per-repo
 * they would be dozens of copies that must be regenerated in lockstep, so they
 * are served from this one place - the repository that already exists to serve
 * all of them - and every README points at raw.githubusercontent.com.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE GENERATED RATHER THAN DRAWN: they have to match a button that
 * already exists. button-buy-me-a-coffee.svg is the vendor's own, 841.9x245.3
 * with a 38.2 corner, and a README renders the row at one fixed width. A
 * hand-drawn box a few units off reads as a wobbly row at that size, so both
 * of these take the same canvas, the same corner, and the same inner 460x120
 * design grid (scaled by 1.830217 and offset to sit centred in the larger box).
 *
 * EACH ONE WEARS ITS OWN BRAND COLOUR (jdp, 2026-09-11). That is the opposite
 * of what the app does, and deliberately so: in the app the buttons are
 * neutral and take the brand only on hover, which a README cannot do at all.
 * GitHub strips <style> and script, an inline style carries no pseudo-classes,
 * and an SVG embedded as <img> never sees the pointer. A flat brand fill is
 * also what makes the row readable in BOTH GitHub themes without a <picture>
 * element, which could not be used here anyway: a <picture> inside an <a> is
 * broken by GitHub's sanitiser, and these buttons are links.
 *
 * The text is rendered to PNG so the lettering is baked. The README points at
 * the PNG for exactly that reason: an <img> of an SVG with a <text> element
 * would fall back to whatever font the viewer's renderer happens to have.
 *
